# Hack Western 2022 - Homies Management System (HMS) 🏠

**Group members**: Arzekeil-Abel De Leon, Angela Wang

## 💡Inspiration

University got us all wandering into new territories and possibly living with some of your _bestest_ friends... or maybe some of the most questionable people you've ever met. Got a roomie that never pays for their part of the toilet paper or dish soap? ...Or even rent? Or one that decides never to clean after themselves and leave a mess in the kitchen? Or maybe one that's always MIA and never responds to any of your messages because the group chat is on Discord and they only like WhatsApp but another roommate hates it? We've all been there. Or at least _we_ have. So that's why we introduce to you the HMS - the homies management system - to aid in the management of your housemates!

## 🤔What it does

Our new development - the Homies Management System (HMS for short) - is a one-stop mobile application to manage all your housemate needs. Need something to help keep track of rent or other communal costs instead of using a random old Excel sheet? Or a way to keep track of house chores and to-dos, communicating with the gang, or even just getting to know them a bit better? The HMS has you covered. One simple application to manage all of that, avoid unnecessary conflicts and being able to rest easy. ..._DISCLAIMER: Unless they don't cooperate at all and refuse to be responsible. We can't help you there. Might want to find another homie. Sorry about that and good luck next time :)_

## 💻How we built it

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend - APIs**: FastAPI
- **Backend - DB**: SQLite
- \+ A lot of other things mentioned in the challenges section

## 🗻Challenges we ran into

- Well... Long story short, we moved from React Native and Firebase to spending _way too much time_ (and I mean _wayyyyyyyyyyy too much_) trying to connect the frontend and the backend, spending our life savings in sleep currency (and slight sanity) switching between axios and fetch but to no avail... To trying to learn Flutter overnight (with the help of the amazing mentors who were super willing to help despite also being sleep deprived :)) and giving up on Firebase and instead creating the entire backend locally in hopes of making the API calls work and connecting the two together, to... well... passing out (and away) and scrambling to finish wrap thnings up

- Having the drive to keep going despite the above situation. Sleep was very tempting and staring at the comfy air mattress didn't really help

## 🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of

Arzekeil

- Learned Flutter & React Native within the span of 24 hours
- Discovering that mobile dev is pretty fun

Angela

- Pulling my first ever all nighter and then passing away on the 2nd night (I feel like a zombie :D)
- The determination I had in trying to debug and get Firebase working and annoying the mentors about it _hehexd my brain is fried_

## 📚What we learned

- React Native, Flutter, more about mobile development in general
  - Seeing changes and being able to tap to see it work was pretty fun :)
  - Angela needs a better computer to run Android emulator to avoid making it go kaboom
- Firebase is pretty cool but also painful in the fact that they make major changes too often and makes stack overflow go against our favour :(
- Lots of bubble tea makes me hyper and then sleepy
- We should go down for food earlier because we missed out on the butter chicken ;-;

## 🔮What's next for Homies Management System (HMS)

- Implementing more features that we had planned out
  - Notifications, cleaning up the UI further, login/authentication, comments on posts, making payment available directly through the app
- Adding Cohere's API to automatically determine tags for posts based on NLP classification
- Cleaning up the UI
- Deploying it so that we can actually get our housemates to download and use it :D
